**Rock, Paper, Scissors** is a simple and interactive game where the player faces off against the computer. The game follows the traditional rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, and Paper beats Rock. Players choose one of the three options, and the computer makes a random selection. Once both choices are made, the game determines the winner based on the rules. The game features an easy-to-use interface with buttons for selecting Rock, Paper, or Scissors, displays the choices of both the player and the computer, and keeps track of the score for each round. It's a fun and engaging way to pass the time with instant results!
